# Thats My Quiz now in React

Live Link: <a href="https://react-quiz-app-v2-refactor.vercel.app/">Click here</a>

This is a complete rewrite and extension of <a href="#"> Thats My Quiz</a> which was made with vanilla JS.

The point in this rewrite was to train my comfortability with:

- React components
- styled components
- props (passing on to several children)
- Forms in react
- conditional rendering (bookmarking, buttons etc.)
- useState management (navigation, createCard-form, etc.)
- useEffect principles
- localStorage
- React Routing

Need to add features:

- Bookmark toggle, state and filtering
- Dark Mode
- Card and Bookmark counter
