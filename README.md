# Thats My Quiz now in React

This is a complete rewrite and extension of <a href="#"> Thats My Quiz</a> which was made with vanilla JS.
The point in this rewrite was to train my comfortability with:

- React components
- conditional rendering (Navigation, Bookmarking, etc.)
- useState management
- useEffect principles
- Forms in react
